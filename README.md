### ðŸ‘‹ Hey welcome to my GitHub profile

 I've got some public repositories here that are mostly Python and website projects. But I've also got a lot of *secret* repos with cool code.

I guess if you are still reading something about me is that I like to make Discord bots with Python!
Some of my public bots are down here:


* Gahyeon Bot: https://top.gg/bot/813634913885618197
<a href="https://top.gg/bot/813634913885618197">
  <img src="https://top.gg/api/widget/813634913885618197.svg" alt="Gahyeon" />
  </a>
  
  
* SlapContinental Bot: https://sites.google.com/view/slapcontinentaldiscordbot/home (To use this bot you gotta join **The Wholesome Bunch** Discord Server)
